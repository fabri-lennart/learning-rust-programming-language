## 🎓 Key Concepts I'm Learning

### 🔐 Ownership
Rust's unique approach to memory management without garbage collection.

### ⚡ Performance
Zero-cost abstractions and compile-time guarantees.

### 🛡️ Safety
Preventing null pointer dereferences and data races at compile time.

### 🔄 Concurrency
Fearless concurrent programming with threads and async/await.

## 💡 Why Rust?

- **Memory Safety** without garbage collection
- **Blazing Fast** performance comparable to C/C++
- **Modern Tooling** with Cargo package manager
- **Great Community** and growing ecosystem
- **Systems Programming** made accessible
